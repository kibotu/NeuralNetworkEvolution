# Documentation Standards

## Core Principle

Avoid over-documentation. Keep documentation centralized in the main `README.md` file.

## Guidelines

- **No redundant documentation**: Don't create multiple README files or documentation files throughout the codebase
- **Single source of truth**: All project documentation should live in the main `README.md` at the project root
- **No documentation files**: Don't create separate `.md` files for features, components, or modules unless absolutely necessary

## What to Document

✅ **DO document in main README.md:**
- Project overview and purpose
- Setup and installation instructions
- Configuration requirements
- API endpoints and usage
- Deployment instructions

❌ **DON'T create:**
- Multiple README files in subdirectories
- Separate documentation files for each feature
- Excessive inline comments explaining obvious code
- Changelog files (use git history instead)
- Architecture documents (unless project is highly complex)

## Code Comments

Only add comments when:
- The logic is non-obvious or complex
- There's a specific reason for an implementation choice
- You're documenting a workaround or known limitation
